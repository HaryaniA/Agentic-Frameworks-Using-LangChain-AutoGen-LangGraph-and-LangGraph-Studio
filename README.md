# Agentic Frameworks: Using LangChain, AutoGen, LangGraph, and LangGraph Studio

A beginner-friendly guide to building AI assistants with popular frameworks like LangChain, AutoGen, LangGraph, and LangGraph Studio.

## What This Project Does

This project shows you how to create AI agents that can search Wikipedia and answer questions. It's designed to be hands-on and easy to follow, even if you're new to AI development.

## What Are AI Agents?

AI agents are systems that can:
- Understand their environment
- Make decisions based on information
- Take actions to reach goals

When built with Large Language Models (LLMs), these agents gain special abilities:

1. **Using Tools**: They can access external resources like search engines or databases
2. **Remembering Things**: They keep track of previous conversations
3. **Making Plans**: They break big problems into smaller, manageable steps
4. **Thinking Things Through**: They consider different options before acting

## Frameworks Covered

- **LangChain**: A popular toolkit for connecting LLMs to other resources
- **AutoGen**: Framework for building autonomous AI agents
- **LangGraph**: Tools for creating multi-step AI workflows
- **LangGraph Studio**: Visual interface for designing AI agent systems

Follow along to build your own Wikipedia-powered AI assistant!
